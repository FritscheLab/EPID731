# EPID731 - Day 2 and Day 4 Materials

This repository contains the materials for **Day 2** and **Day 4** of the short course **EPID731: Analysis Of Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data**, offered at the University of Michigan.

### Crash Course and Setup

For a detailed guide on setting up your environment (for R and Python), navigating the repository, and using the materials in Google Colab, please see the **[Crash Course Guide](CRASHCOURSE.md)**. This guide provides step-by-step instructions, links to external tutorials, and other useful information to get you started.

### Day 2: Accessing EHR Data with R

The materials for Day 2 focus on accessing and analyzing EHR data using the R programming language. The Jupyter Notebook [`Day2/EPID731_Accessing_EHR_Data.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FritscheLab/EPID731/blob/main/Day2/EPID731_Accessing_EHR_Data.ipynb) provides a hands-on introduction to this topic. A bonus notebook, [`Day2/EPID731_BonusWhiteRabbit.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FritscheLab/EPID731/blob/main/Day2/EPID731_BonusWhiteRabbit.ipynb), provides a tutorial on using the White Rabbit tool for data quality assessment.

### Day 4: Harmonizing Medication Data with GPT

The focus of Day 4, taught by Lars Fritsche, is on using Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) to harmonize medication data. The materials include:

*   A Jupyter Notebook ([`Day4/EPID731_Medication_Classification_with_OpenAI_GPT_API.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/FritscheLab/EPID731/blob/main/Day4/EPID731_Medication_Classification_with_OpenAI_GPT_API.ipynb)) that demonstrates how to use the OpenAI GPT API for medication classification.
*   Python scripts for batch processing of medication data.
*   Example configuration files, prompts, and input data.

> **Note for Live Session:** Participants should open the notebook in Google Colab by clicking the link above or the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the notebook.

### Description

This short course offers an overview of modern analytical methods and research applications using EHR data, with a specific focus on epidemiologic inferences.
